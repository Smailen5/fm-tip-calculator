## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind
- JavaScript

### What I learned

With `min="1"`, I saved myself 5 lines of code to verify that the entered value was greater than 0 XD GGGGGGGG source w3school

```html
<input min="1" />
```

Converting strings into numbers was easy; I remembered that there's already a function for this:

```js
tipInput.addEventListener("input", function (event) {
  const tipNumber = Number(event.target.value);
});
```

`Number()` instead of `toNumber()`, as I initially thought.

### Continued development

I want to add the custom button in the future. For now, I've only created it, but I haven't figured out how to make it work as requested.
